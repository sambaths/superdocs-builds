"""Synthesize clausekeeper VO segments via Kokoro TTS am_eric (Apache 2.0).

Ticket 0019 delivery: a paused, human-walkthrough cadence. Each beat's spoken
paragraph in docs/media/narration-script.txt is mirrored beat-for-beat in
VO_TEXTS and synthesized per sentence at speed 0.97, then assembled with
silence: 0.15 s lead-in, 0.32 s between sentences, 0.25 s tail.

- Uses explicit KPipeline(lang_code='a') + pre-loaded en_core_web_sm to avoid HF hang.
- Written for the ear: VO_TEXTS carries meaning only — identifiers, filenames,
  timestamps, job/change ids, ISO stamps, HTTP routes, and header names are
  never spoken (slide caption bars and terminal footage carry those).
- Measured numbers match docs/writeup.md exactly (number parity rule).
- Concatenates per-sentence Kokoro chunks with the pause scheme, writes
  24000 Hz AIFF (PCM_16) -> out/media/vo-b*.aiff; ffprobe reports duration
  per segment plus the sum; an audit log line records voice/speed/license.

Usage: python tools/synth_vo.py [--dry]  # dry prints texts without synthesizing
